# City-Pollution-Reduction-Plan-in-R
This R Shiny application serves as a linear programming optimization tool designed to select the most cost-effective combination of mitigation projects to meet specific city pollution reduction targets. Instead of using pre-built solver libraries, this project implements a custom Simplex Algorithm from scratch to solve the minimization problem.
